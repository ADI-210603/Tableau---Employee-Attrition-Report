## üéØ Key Insights & Analysis

The dashboard brings several critical findings to light:

* **Overall Attrition:** The company has a significant attrition rate of **16.12%**, with **237** employees leaving out of a total of **1,470**.
* **Departmental Hotspot:** The **Sales Department** is the largest contributor to attrition, accounting for over half (**56.12%**) of all departures. This warrants an immediate, focused investigation.
* **Age-Related Trends:** Attrition is highest among younger employees, particularly in the **25-34 age group**. This suggests potential challenges in retaining early to mid-career talent.
* **Gender Disparity:** While more **males (150)** have left in absolute numbers compared to females (87), a deeper analysis of the attrition rate per gender would be required for a complete picture.
* **Education Background:** Employees with backgrounds in **Life Sciences** and **Medical** fields are leaving most frequently, indicating a possible misalignment between their career goals and the opportunities provided.
